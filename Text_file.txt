Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on 
creating machines and systems capable of performing tasks that usually require
human intelligence. These tasks include learning, problem-solving, decision-making,
speech recognition, and image processing. AI works by using large amounts of data,
algorithms, and computing power to identify patterns and make predictions or 
decisions. It is widely used today in various fields such as healthcare, finance, 
education, transportation, and entertainment. From voice assistants like Siri and 
Alexa to self-driving cars and advanced medical diagnosis, AI is transforming the 
way we live and work, making processes faster, smarter, and more efficient.
